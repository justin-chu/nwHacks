      ℹ️ Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve
      automatically through experience.[1] It is seen as a subset of artificial
      intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample
      data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions
      without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning
      algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email
      filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to
      develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. ℹ️ Machine
